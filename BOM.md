#Bill of Materials

Below is a work in progress bill of materials for each individual kit.  This only includes "robot parts," and does not include (necessary) building supplies such as double sided tape and foam-core/cardboard.  This also leaves out "bulk products" such as 22awg wire, which can be purchased most economically by the roll.  Part pricing is assuming 25x kit production.
